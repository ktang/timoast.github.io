Iâ€™m Tim Stuart, a postdoc in the [Satija lab](http://satijalab.org/) at the New York Genome Center. I work on single cell genomics.

Previously I did my PhD in the [Lister lab](http://listerlab.org/) at the University of Western Australia, where I studied epigenetics and plant transposable elements.
