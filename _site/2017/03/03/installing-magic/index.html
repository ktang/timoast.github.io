<h1 id="installing-magic">Installing magic</h1>

<p>Recently a method for imputing single cell gene expression matricies
was posted
on <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/25/111591">biorxiv</a> by
David van Dijk et al., called magic (Markov Affinity-based Graph
Imputation of Cells). I’ve been analysing single cell RNA-seq data
recently, and this method looks like it could be useful when trying to
find co-transcriptional networks, as single cell data suffers from
dropout which makes finding co-transcriptional networks hard.</p>

<p>I had lots of problems getting magic installed and running, so will
document them here for future reference.</p>

<p>Firstly, there seems to be an error in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">setup.py</code> script where it
looks for a non-existent <code class="highlighter-rouge">/data</code> directory that should contain test
data. Running <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip3 install .</code> as instructed in the readme resulted in
an error, and I have raised
an <a href="https://github.com/pkathail/magic/issues/12">issue</a> on
github. Commenting out the last few lines of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">setup.py</code> script
seemed to provide a temporary fix.</p>

<p>The next problem was getting <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tk</code> to work properly with python. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tk</code>
is a GUI toolkit and not park of python itself. Chances are
that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tk</code> is installed somewhere on your computer, and the problem is that
python doesn’t know where it is. After trying lots of different
things, the solution I found was to install python3 using the mac
installer and launching IDLE, as this finds and links the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tk</code>
installation with python at runtime. From the
python <a href="https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/">website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Python for Mac OS X installers downloaded from this website
dynamically link at runtime to Tcl/Tk macOS frameworks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then found the path of the newly installed python3 (it was symlinked
to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/bin/python3</code> for me) and used this to create a new
virtualenv:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>mkvirtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python3 py3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I then installed magic again in the virtualenv (from the github repo):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip3 install .
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Next I installed all the jupyter stuff. It’s important to link the
right ipython kernel to the jupyter notebook, otherwise it will seem
like you still don’t have access to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tk</code>, even though at this point
you can sucessfully <code class="highlighter-rouge">import tkinter</code> in python3. To do this, install
jupyter, ipython, the ipython kernel, and then link the
kernel:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install jupyter ipython ipykernel
python3 -m ipykernel install --user
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now you should be able to import magic without any problems, and use
it in a jupyter notebook. You can also start the GUI by running the <code class="highlighter-rouge">magic_gui.py</code> script:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>python3 magic_gui.py
</code></pre>
</div>
