title: A paper a day
layout: post

In an effort to read more papers this year, I'm going to read a paper (or something paper-like) each day for the remainder of the year, and post each paper below as I go.

Crisp PA, Ganguly D, Eichten SR, Borevitz JO, Pogson BJ. 2016. Reconsidering plant memory: Intersections between stress recovery, RNA turnover, and epigenetics. Science Advances 2: e1501340–e1501340. [doi:10.1126/sciadv.1501340](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/2/2/e1501340.full)

*Interesting or important points:*  

> An as yet entirely unexplored possibility is the prospect that transcriptional memory might be underpinned by changes in mRNA stability rather than transcription. 

I think certain RNA modifications have been shown to be induced by stress (at least in yeast), perhaps they play a role in modifying mRNA stability to facilitate stress memory.
